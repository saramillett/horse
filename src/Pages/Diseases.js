                    <p>An abcess is caused by a stone bruise
                        or something embedded in the hoof.
                        It happens when bacteria get trapped
                        inside the hoof. Nails, glass, and screws
                        can get caught inside the hoof and leave bacteria.
                        Routine hoof care and keeping your horseâ€™s 
                        area clean can prevent abscesses.
